# Customer Behavior Data Analysis – Portfolio Project

## This project showcases a complete, industry-standard, end-to-end data analytics workflow, designed to reflect real-world responsibilities of a Data Analyst in a business environment.

The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw customer data into actionable business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade analytics workflow, covering all critical stages of data analysis:

## Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Cleaning, preprocessing, and exploring customer behavior data to uncover patterns and anomalies.

## Data Modeling & Business Analysis (SQL)
Loading processed data into a relational database and writing SQL queries to analyze customer segments, purchasing behavior, and loyalty metrics.

## Data Visualization & Insights (Power BI)
Designing an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders understand trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Reporting & Presentation
Summarizing insights, key findings, and business recommendations in a structured report and presentation.

## Tools & Technologies Used

	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	
	SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server)
	
	Power BI
	
	Jupyter Notebook
	
	Git & GitHub

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/VivekSonawane7/customer_trends_data_analysis_SQL_Python_PowerBI.git

cd customer_trends_data_analysis_SQL_Python_PowerBI

### Step 2: Run the Python Notebook

	Open Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb to perform:
	
	Data import
	
	Data cleaning
	
	Exploratory Data Analysis
	
	SQL database connection

### Step 3: Load Data into SQL Database

	Create a database in MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server
	
	Use the Python notebook to load cleaned data into SQL
	
	Run queries from customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql to answer business questions

### Step 4: Power BI Dashboard

	Open customer_trend_analysis.pbix
	
	Connect Power BI to the SQL database
	
	Explore interactive visualizations and insights

### Step 5: Reporting & Presentation

	Create a project report summarizing insights
	
	Prepare a business presentation with recommendations
	
	Business Questions Answered
	
	Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?
	
	How does purchase behavior vary by age, gender, and location?
	
	What factors influence repeat purchases and customer loyalty?
	
	Which products and categories perform best over time?
	
## Key Learnings

	Converting raw data into business-ready insights
	
	Writing efficient and meaningful SQL queries
	
	Designing dashboards for non-technical stakeholders
